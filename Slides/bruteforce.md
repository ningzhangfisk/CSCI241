# Brute Force Algorithm
# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Definition
+ It is an intuitive, direct, and straightforward technique of problem-solving in which all the possible ways or all the possible solutions to a given problem are enumerated.
## 1.2 Pros and Cons
### Pros
+ The brute force approach is a guaranteed way to find the correct solution by listing all the possible candidate solutions for the problem.
+ It is a generic method and not limited to any specific domain of problems.
+ The brute force method is ideal for solving small and simpler problems.
+ It is known for its simplicity and can serve as a comparison benchmark.
### Cons
+   The brute force approach is inefficient. For real-time problems, algorithm analysis often goes above the `O(N!)` order of growth.
+   This method relies more on compromising the power of a computer system for solving a problem than on a good algorithm design.
+   Brute force algorithms are slow.
+   Brute force algorithms are not constructive or creative compared to algorithms that are constructed using some other design paradigms.
