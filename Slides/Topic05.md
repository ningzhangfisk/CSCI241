# CSCI 241
# Topic 5: Recursion

# 1. The Recursion Pattern
+ `Recursion`: when a method calls itself
+ Classic example â€“ the factorial function:

~~~~
n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*....*2*1
~~~~

+ Recursive definition:

# 2. Content of a Recursion Method

+ Base case(s):
  - Values of the input variables for which we perform no recursive calls are called base cases (there should be at least one base case).
  - Every possible chain of recursive calls must eventually reach a base case.
+ Recursive calls
  - calls to the recursive method
  - each recursive call should be defined so that it makes progress towards a base case.
+ Visualizing Recursion
  - A box for each recursive call
  - An arrow from each caller to callee
  - An arrow from each callee to caller showing return value

# 3. Binary search
+ Search for an integer in an ordered array.
+ We consider four cases:
  - If `low` > `high`, then we could not found the `target`.
  - If `target` equals `data[mid]`, then we have found the `target`.
  - If `target` < `data[mid]`, then we recur on the first half of the sequence.
  - If `target` > `data[mid]`, then we recur on the second half of the sequence.

+ Base cases:
  - `low > high`
  - `target == data[mid]`
+ Recursive calls
  - `target` < `data[mid]
  - `target` > `data[mid]`

+ Analyze binary search
  - Each recursive call divides the search region  in half. Hence, there can be at most `log(n)` levels.(We will learn the details in next topic)

# 4. Fibonacci Numbers
+ Fibonacci numbers are defined recursively:

+ Recursive algorithm(binary recursive method)

~~~~
Algorithm: Fibonacci(n):
  Input: non-negative integer n
  Output: the nth Fibonacci number Fn
  if n=0 or n=1 then
    return n
  else
    return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)
