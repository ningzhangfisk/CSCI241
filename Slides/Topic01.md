## 1.1 [String matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm)
+ Given a string `str1="I love Fisk, I love Fisk University, I love Fisk University"` and a substring `str2="Fisk University"`,
+ Find if `str1` contains `str2`. If so, return the position of the first occurence, otherwise, return -1.
+ Complete the matching/searching as soon as possible
+ Your solution?

## 1.3 [8 Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle#:~:text=The%20eight%20queens%20puzzle%20is,in%20the%20mid%2D19th%20century.)
+ The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.
