# 7.2 Binary Trees
+ A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:
  - Every node has at most `two children`.
  - Each child node is labeled as being either a `left child` or a `right child`.
  - A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node.
+ The subtree rooted at a left or right child of an internal node v is called a `left subtree` or `right subtree`, respectively, of v.
+ A binary tree is `proper` if each node has either zero or two children. Some people also refer to such trees as being full binary trees. Thus, in a proper binary tree, every internal node has exactly two children. A binary tree that is not proper is `improper`.
+ An important class of binary trees arises in contexts where we wish to represent a number of different outcomes that can result from answering a series of yes-or-no questions.
